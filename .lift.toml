# Some caution is required when changing the settings of sonatype-lift.
# - FindSecBugs does not work if this file is in a subdirectory
# - Closure-Compiler will not work if ignoreRules is added

# - [JSHint] Almost never works by default and fails
# - [Rubocop] It currently only provides false positives. Ruby is used at build but not shipped. 
disableTools = [ "JSHint", "Rubocop" ]

# - [Error Prone: OperatorPrecedence, UnnecessaryParentheses]
#   Both are discarded and the PMD rule of "UnnecessaryParentheses" is respected.
#   Unlike PMD, UnnecessaryParentheses of Error Prone causes noise in code auto-generated by ANTLR.
# - [Error Prone: YodaCondition]
#   There are problems such as rough type detection creating conflicts with other tools and not detecting changed content.
#   Also conflicts with own rule ObjectEqualsForPrimitives)
ignoreRules = [ "OperatorPrecedence", "UnnecessaryParentheses", "YodaCondition" ]
